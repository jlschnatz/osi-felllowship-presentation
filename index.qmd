## Exemplifying Data

### Comparing the Standard Literature against Registered Reports

![Data from: @scheel2021excess](img/scheel_etal_2021.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" fig-alt="Data of Scheel et al. (2021) indicating that 96% of the standard literature, the first hypothesis is supported, while only 44% is supported in publication bias absent registered reports."}

## Background 

### Relevance for Open Science


*Publication bias leads to...*

- Inflation of meta-analytical effect sizes [@franco2014publication]
- Increased false-positive rate

&rarr; Publication bias threatens the validity of science and is a significant driver of the **replication crisis** in psychology [@munafo2017manifesto]

## Current Practices & Their Limitations

## Introducing SPEEC

- **SPEEC**: **S**imulation-based **P**ublication Bias **E**stimation and **E**ffect Size **C**orrection
- Main Idea: Explicit modelling of the generative process of publication bias in a simulation framework

## Preliminary Assessement of SPEEC

## Outlook

## Nexts Steps

- Account for between-study effect size heterogeneity in the simulation framework
- Conduct thorough simulation study to assess SPEEC
- Include other factors that are influencing the joint distribution of effect size and sample size (such as sample size planning, p-hacking, etc.)
- What I will do with the money: DGPS 2024 


## Additional theme classes

### Some extra things you can do with the clean theme

Special classes for emphasis

- `.alert` class for default emphasis, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

Cross-references

- `.button` class provides a Beamer-like button, e.g.
[[Summary]{.button}](#sec-summary)

## Want more?

### See our longer demo slides

We've deliberarely kept this template lean, to get you up and running as fast as
possible.

We provide a separate
[demo template](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo),
with more examples for integrating code, tables, figures, etc.

  - See the live demo slides
  [here](https://grantmcdermott.com/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo/template.html).

## Summary {#sec-summary}

### A minimalist and elegant presentation theme

The Quarto reveal.js clean theme aims to be a minimalist and elegant presention
theme. Here are some options to get you started:

Add the theme to an existing project.

```{.bash}
quarto install extension grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

... or, create a new project using this slide deck as a lean template.

```{.bash}
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

... or, create a new project using the demo slide deck as a full template.

```{.bash}
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo
```
