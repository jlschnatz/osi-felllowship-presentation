## Background

### Comparing the Standard Literature against Registered Reports

Exemplifying data by @scheel2021excess

![](img/scheel_etal_2021.png){fig-align="center" width="50%" fig-alt="Data of Scheel et al. (2021) indicating that 96% of the standard literature, the first hypothesis is supported, while only 44% is supported in publication bias absent registered reports."}

## Background 

### Relevance for Open Science

*Publication bias leads to...*

- Inflation of meta-analytical effect sizes [@franco2014publication]
- Increased false-positive rate [@kicinski2014does]

&rarr; Publication bias threatens the validity of science and is a significant driver of the **replication crisis** in psychology [@munafo2017manifesto]

## Background
### Existing Methods to Assess Publication Bias

General classification into:

- Methods based on the relationship between effect size and sample size in meta-analyses (*small-study effects*) 
- Methods working with *p*-values


## Background
### Criticisms of existing Methods

- Small-study effects methods: lack of an *explicit* model for publication bias &rarr; only indirect approach to assess publication bias
- Publication bias is not the only factor influencing the distribution of effect size and sample size &rarr; *sample size planning*
- Several simulation studies show that many existing methods perform poorly in realistic empirical meta-analytical scenarios: 
  - Effect size heterogeneity
  - Additional *p*-hacking and other QRPs
  - Limited number of individual studies included in the meta-analysis
  - Severity of publication bias

## Introducing SPEEC

&rarr; Explicit modeling framework to assess publication bias with ability to account for relevant discussed factors in the context of publication bias 

::: {.incremental}

- **SPEEC**: **S**imulation-based **P**ublication Bias **E**stimation and **E**ffect Size **C**orrection
- Main Idea
  - Explicit modelling of the generative process of publication bias in a simulation framework 
  - Iteratively comparing the "closeness" of the simulated joint effect size sample size distributions with the empirical meta-analytical data to estimate the parameters of the method

## SPEEC Worklow

![](img/speec_workflow.png){fig-align="center"}


## Preliminary Assessement of SPEEC

- Proof of concept study
- Utilisation of secondary data [@linden2021heterogeneity] with 150 classical meta-analyses and 57 registered replication reports
- Confirmatory results suggested problems within the parameter estimation of SPEEC
- Exploratory results aimed to identify potential root causes of estimation problems
  - Unaccounted between-study effect size heterogeneity in the simulation framework

## Outlook

### Nexts Steps

Interested in further details see [thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlschnatz/bachelor-thesis/master/manuscript/thesis-schnatz_submitted.pdf)

- Account for between-study effect size heterogeneity in the simulation framework
- Conduct thorough simulation study to assess SPEEC
- Include other factors that are influencing the joint distribution of effect size and sample size (such as sample size planning, p-hacking, etc.)
- What I will do with the money: DGPS 2024 

## Acknowledgments

Finally, I want to deeply thank Martin and Julia who supported me along the way of this project!
